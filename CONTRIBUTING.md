## How to contribute

Each post has an edit button which should take you to a page where you can edit that particular post. In doing so, Github will automatically [fork the repository][fork] and [open a pull request][pull] to merge your contributions back into the project.

The process of [editing a file in another user's repository][edit] is pretty simple. Thanks [Github][github]!

If you have any questions, please [submit an issue][issue].
